imgsort
=======

**imgsort** is a tool for sorting images by a variety of features.
Currently sorting by hue, saturation, brightness, and resolution are available.
For a help menu, type "path/to/imgsort.py -h" into your console.

Requires Pillow to run.
```
pip install pillow
```

You may optionally install tqdm for progress bars.
```
pip install tqdm
```

##Example usage
Sort the files by hue and print the list to console:
```
david@~$ ./imgsort.py image_directory/ -p hue -l
red_image.gif
blue_image.png
david@~$ 
```

Sort the files by dimensions and rename to be sorted lexicographically:
```
david@~$ ./imgsort.py image_directory/ -p dimensions -r

```

Options currently include sorting by hue, saturation, brightness, and resolution/dimensions.

Sorting can either be by renaming files or listing the files in order to your console.

Sorting by average color based values can take a long time. To sort my directory with 1000+ wallpapers it takes around 5 minutes to sort by hue.
Additionally, sorting by average color frequently gives results that don't appear to be 'sorted' from a humans perspective.
